The number of integral points $X(k)$ on a hyperbolic curve $X$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ is finite.
But how do you find those points?

Minhyong Kim's non-abelian Chabauty method gives a $p$-adic approach to answer this question.
The theoretical inspiration to use quotients of the fundamental group comes from anabelian geometry.
The resulting algorithms are some of the best available to calculate integral points.
And the methods along the way involve Jacobians, $p$-adic integration and $p$-adic heights on curves.

The aim of this workshop is to give an introduction into these beautiful ideas, mixed with  exercise sessions and research talks to give a glimpse of what lies ahead.
